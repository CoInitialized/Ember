## What is it?

This allows user for fast creation of automatic ML pipelines with uses or libraries like:

- Scikit-learn
- Category encoders
- CatBoost
- XGBoost
- LightXGM
- hyperopt

To your disposal are:

- Independent modules like preprocessing, optimize, etc.
- Automatic Learner Module - autolearn

## How to use it?

There are two ways you can use this library. For most cases you will want to use submodules to aid your machine learning models development.
